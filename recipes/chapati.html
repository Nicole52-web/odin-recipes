    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Add flour, salt and sugar in a mixing bowl. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add 3-4 tbsp oil and rub into the flour.</li>
        <li>Add the measured warm water and form a soft dough. Add any extra water required, tablespoon at a time as you don't want the dough too soft.</li>
        <li>The dough should not be sticky. </li>
        <li>Take a tbsp of oil and knead it into the dough.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth, lid or cling film. Allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into six parts. Roll each part into a ball. </li>
        <li>Cover the balls with a damp cloth. Allow them to rest for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Dust the worktop with some flour.</li>
        <li>Roll one dough ball out into a circle about 6-7 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Smear about 1 tsp solid ghee or butter all over the rolled dough.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a bit of flour all over.</li>
        <li>Fold the rolled dough into a fan shape. Check out the video.</li>
        <li>Then roll it into a spiral shape.</li>
        <li>Allow the dough to rest for 10 minutes. In the meantime can roll and shape the remaining 5 dough balls.</li>
        <li>Dust the worktop with some flour. </li>
        <li>Take one of the spiral dough and roll it out flat into a circle of about 6-7 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle, tawa or frying pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Place the rolled out chapati over the griddle. Allow it roast for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip it over and allow the other side to roast for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Smear about 1 tsp oil, ghee or butter all over the top side. Flip it over.</li>
        <li>Roast or cook till brown specks appear.</li>
        <li>Smear oil, ghee or butter on the top dry side.</li>
        <li>Flip and roast. Roast till the chapati is done. Should see brown specks all over the chapati and some of the layers should come apart.</li>
        <li>Repeat the same with the remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Serve hot Kenyan Chapati with your favourite curry or stew. Or serve it hot with some tea.</li>
